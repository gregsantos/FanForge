# FanForge Project Charter

## Mission Statement

Create a collaborative platform that eliminates legal gray areas in fan-created derivative content by connecting IP owners with creators through sanctioned campaigns, enabling systematic harnessing of fan creativity for mutual benefit.

## Problem Statement

Fan creators and brand enthusiasts face legal gray areas when creating derivative content using brand assets, while IP owners struggle to systematically harness fan creativity for marketing and engagement. Current solutions either restrict fan expression or create legal risks, missing opportunities for mutually beneficial collaboration between creators and brands that could drive both creative fulfillment and business value.

## Success Metrics

**Primary KPI:** Monthly active creators successfully submitting and getting approved derivative works using official brand asset kits

**Supporting Metrics:**

- Campaign creation rate by brand administrators
- Creator submission approval rates
- Platform user growth across creator and brand segments
- Legal compliance effectiveness
