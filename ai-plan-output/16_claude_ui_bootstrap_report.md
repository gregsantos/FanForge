### Key Architectural Decisions

- Route Groups: Used parentheses syntax (auth), (brand), (creator) for logical organization without
  affecting URL structure
- Component Organization: Separated UI primitives, domain-specific components, and shared components
- Type Safety: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- Static Export Ready: Configured for deployment to static hosting platforms

## 2. Component Library

### Core UI Components

- Button: 5 variants (default, destructive, outline, secondary, ghost) with loading states
- Input: Form input with integrated error display and validation
- Card: Flexible card system with header, content, and footer sections
- Badge: Status indicators with semantic color variants
- Navigation: Role-based responsive navigation with mobile drawer

### Domain-Specific Components

- Creation Canvas: Three-panel drag-and-drop interface for artwork composition
- Asset Palette: Categorized asset browser with drag initiation
- Campaign Cards: Discovery interface with preview and metadata
- Portfolio Grid: Creator submission tracking with status management

### Component Features

- Responsive Design: Mobile-first approach with breakpoint-specific layouts
- Dark Mode Ready: CSS custom properties for seamless theme switching
- Accessibility: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- Interactive States: Hover, focus, active, and loading states

## 3. Routing Setup

### Route Structure Implementation

Based on the wireflow specification, implemented the following route hierarchy:

#### Anonymous Routes

- / - Landing page with value proposition and CTAs
- /login - User authentication
- /register - User registration with role selection

#### Creator Routes (/creator prefix implied by route group)

- /discover - Campaign discovery with search and filtering
- /portfolio - Personal submission tracking and approved works showcase

#### Brand Admin Routes (/brand prefix implied by route group)

- /dashboard - Campaign overview and analytics (prepared)
- /campaigns - Campaign creation and management (prepared)
- /submissions - Submission review workflow (prepared)

### Navigation Logic

- Role-Based Rendering: Navigation items dynamically adjust based on user role
- Active State Management: Visual indication of current page using usePathname
- Mobile Responsiveness: Collapsible drawer navigation for mobile devices

## 4. API Integration

### Mock API Implementation

Implemented comprehensive mock API following the provided contract specification:

#### Authentication Endpoints

- POST /api/auth/register - User registration with role validation
- POST /api/auth/login - User authentication with mock JWT tokens

#### Campaign Endpoints

- GET /api/campaigns - Campaign listing with search and pagination
- POST /api/campaigns - Campaign creation for brand admins
- GET /api/campaigns/[id] - Campaign details with asset information

#### Submission Endpoints

- GET /api/submissions - Submission listing with filtering
- POST /api/submissions - Artwork submission creation

### Data Management Strategy

- Client-Side State: React Hook Form for form state management
- API Integration: Fetch-based calls with error handling
- Mock Data: Realistic placeholder data for demonstrable UX
- Type Safety: Full TypeScript integration for API responses

## 5. Design System Implementation

### Design Token Integration

Implemented comprehensive design system following the provided design tokens:

#### Color System

- Primary Palette: Blue spectrum (50-900) for brand elements and actions
- Secondary Palette: Purple spectrum (50-900) for creative features
- Semantic Colors: Success, warning, error, and info variants
- Dark Mode: Complete dark theme implementation with CSS custom properties

#### Typography Scale

- Font Family: Inter for primary text, JetBrains Mono for code
- Scale: 9-step modular scale from xs (12px) to 5xl (48px)
- Weights: Light (300) to Bold (700) with semantic usage

#### Spacing System

- Consistent Scale: 8px base unit with logical increments
- Component Padding: Standardized internal spacing
- Layout Margins: Consistent external spacing patterns

### Component Styling Approach

- Utility-First: Tailwind CSS for rapid development and consistency
- Component Variants: Class Variance Authority for systematic component variations
- Custom Properties: CSS variables for theme-aware styling
- Responsive Design: Mobile-first breakpoint system

## 6. Responsive Design Approach

### Breakpoint Strategy

- Mobile: 320px-767px with single-column layouts and touch optimization
- Tablet: 768px-1023px with two-column layouts and hybrid interactions
- Desktop: 1024px+ with full feature sets and multi-column layouts

#### Mobile Optimizations

- Navigation: Collapsible drawer with touch-friendly targets
- Canvas Interface: Simplified tools with gesture support consideration
- Card Layouts: Stacked presentation with optimized content hierarchy
- Typography: Responsive scaling for improved readability

### Cross-Browser Compatibility
