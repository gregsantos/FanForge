# FanForge Product Development Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the creation of 14 interconnected Markdown files for FanForge, a platform connecting IP owners with fan creators for sanctioned derivative content creation. The goal is to launch from 0-1 in 30 calendar days by July 8, 2025.

## Input Variables Processed

- **APP_NAME**: FanForge
- **DEADLINE**: 2025-07-08
- **PROBLEM_STATEMENT**: Fan creators face legal gray areas with derivative content while IP owners struggle to harness fan creativity
- **NORTH_STAR_METRIC**: Monthly active creators successfully submitting and getting approved derivative works using official brand asset kits
- **TECH_STACK**: React 18 + Next.js App Router + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **BRAND_TONE**: Modern, Creative, Professional, Collaborative, Empowering, Trustworthy, Intuitive

## File Generation Sequence & Dependencies

### Phase 1: Strategic Foundation

1. **executive_summary.md** - High-level overview and success metrics
2. **charter.md** - One-page project charter (depends on executive summary)
3. **personas.md** - Three user personas (depends on charter)
4. **journey_map.md** - User journey for primary persona (depends on personas)

### Phase 2: Product Specification

5. **prd.md** - Product Requirements Document (depends on charter, personas, journey)
6. **technical_requirements.md** - Complete tech stack and commands (depends on PRD)
7. **copy_deck.md** - Information architecture and UX copy (depends on PRD features)
8. **wireflow.md** - Low-fidelity user flows (depends on IA and copy)

### Phase 3: Technical Architecture

9. **architecture_rfc.md** - Technical architecture with ERD (depends on features and tech requirements)
10. **design_tokens.md** - Design system and components (depends on brand tone and copy)

### Phase 4: Implementation Guides

11. **ci_cd.md** - Repository structure and CI/CD (depends on tech requirements)
12. **ui_bootstrap_instructions.md** - Frontend implementation (depends on all design artifacts)
13. **development_setup.md** - Environment setup (depends on tech requirements and repo structure)
14. **test_plan.md** - Testing strategy (depends on PRD and technical architecture)

## Critical Consistency Checkpoints

- **Technology Stack Alignment**: All files must reference React 18, Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Command Consistency**: npm commands must align across all implementation files
- **Feature Alignment**: All technical artifacts must support the core workflows defined in PRD
- **Brand Consistency**: Design tokens and copy must reflect the defined brand tone
- **Architecture Coherence**: API contracts, ERD, and component structure must align

## Success Criteria

- All 14 files generated with proper Markdown formatting
- Technology stack consistency validated across all artifacts
- Implementation guides provide actionable steps for 30-day launch
- All dependencies properly referenced using [[BRACKETED_IDS]]
