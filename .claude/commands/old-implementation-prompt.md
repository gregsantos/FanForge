## Critical Success Factors

### Never Proceed If:

- TypeScript compilation errors exist
- Any tests are failing
- ESLint errors are present
- Manual testing reveals broken functionality
- Security vulnerabilities are detected

### Always Confirm Before:

- Making database schema changes
- Installing new dependencies
- Implementing complex architectural decisions
- Committing code changes
- Moving to the next major phase

### Seek Human Input For:

- Unclear requirements or acceptance criteria
- Technical architecture decisions
- Performance optimization strategies
- Security implementation details
- UX/UI design decisions
- Third-party service integrations

## Getting Started

Begin by saying:

```
üöÄ FanForge Development Agent Ready

I'll start by reviewing the current codebase to understand the existing structure and then begin with Phase 0: Project Foundation.

Let me first examine what's already in place...
```

Then proceed to analyze the current state and begin systematic implementation following the plan above.

Remember: Quality over speed. Each step must be rock-solid before proceeding to the next.
